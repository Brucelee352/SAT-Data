Vocabulary.com,Support,Troy Ortiz,good,"This isn't necessarily a good or bad level of support. There should be a neutral option to select and that's what I would have chosen. My first initial question just wasn't specifically answered to my liking. Troy was professional in her approach and was expedient in answering which was awesome. I was just looking for a direct answer to my question of where the definitions come from in vocabulary.com and if they came from in house staff, where do they themselves get the definitions from... Different textbooks, encyclopedias, a round table discussion amongst themselves.. Where? 

The reason why I asked is because unlike many other sources I've seen (even official one's like Britannica), vocabulary.com does not have bias in their definitions - which is a really really good thing! Some online sources are slightly biased to make someone believe something, instead of giving someone the pure definition and letting them process the information on their own. That's why I asked where specifically the definitions come from.",2020-08-28T21:00:47-04:00

Vocabulary.com,Support,Brandon Lee,good,"Thank you so much for  your actual interest in the email I sent you.  I am a conservative voter, but I will not associate myself with either the Democrats or the Republicans because I feel both political parties are very corrupt and comprise the ""swamp.""  I also know that the general population is completely unaware of true conservative news--because it does not get mainstream printed.  I get my news from the radio (there are a few conservative stations, such as, American Family Radio) and the conservative Internet  sites (e.g., One News Now).  So when you create  your vocabulary wordlist, you are using what is available. Unfortunately, the extent to which all the major news sources are sympathetic to the extreme left is unprecedented in our history.  Fox News is no longer the conservative source it once was.  Anyway, thank you again for your response to my inquiry.  As I mentioned initially, I use your material when I teach international students.  Thank you so much.",2020-08-26T19:47:10-04:00

I am an Old New England-er, born in this U.S. of A and proud of it. If the accepted dictionary authorities are presenting or including the ""medial flap"" form of pronunciation in their reference sources, then I guess I have fallen behind the times. I would regret to see such a thing happen, but change, I suppose, is inevitable.

I hasten to say, though, that I won't actually be satisfied if you don't emend your definition. Yours is a great website, and I hope to use it extensively in the future, but my confidence is eroded when I see ""sordid"" included in the definition for ""furtive"" -- especially when the word ""underhanded"" would be a far superior substitution. It's errors like this that lead me to seek out other options for my class, my department, and my school.

With very best wishes,
